# FGO NP Damage Calculator

A web application to calculate a servant's NP damage.

## Motivation

I like doing min-turns/TAs in FGO and calculating NP damage is a way to determine if I can reach the necessary damage in order to lessen the time to field test.

The web app is a personal project to improve my skills on front-end development and to gain new knowledge regarding calculating damages.

The web app is by no means a tool to replace the existing FGO damage calculators available.

These two amazing FGO calculators inspired me to work on the web app:

- [maketakunai](https://maketakunai.github.io/)
- [keinoda](https://keinoda.github.io/fgocalc/)

## Thanks to

- [Atlas Academy](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/) for the assets and data
- [fgo-calc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fgo-calc) for handling damage calculations
